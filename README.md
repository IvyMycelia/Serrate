# Serrate Compiler

### What Is It?

Serrate is a statically typed compiled language with C-level semantics but a minimalistic yet simple syntax. Its sole purpose (for right now) is to self-host to eventually compile Serrate code into Serrate.

### Why Serrate?

I'm bored. I want to practice / improve my C knowledge and overall programming ability. Also, I despise other languages. This will be a fun project to work on, amongst the many others I start, get somewhere, but never actually finish!

### Should I Use Serrate?

For anything production level? Probably not. If you want to give it a test drive, roast me, or something similar? By all means!

### Are You Clinically Insane?
